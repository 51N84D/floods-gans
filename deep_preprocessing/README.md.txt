Code has been adapted from :

@INPROCEEDINGS{Chen:2018:DPE,
	AUTHOR    = {Yu-Sheng Chen and Yu-Ching Wang and Man-Hsin Kao and Yung-Yu Chuang},
	TITLE     = {Deep Photo Enhancer: Unpaired Learning for Image Enhancement from Photographs with GANs},
	YEAR      = {2018},
	MONTH     = {June},
	BOOKTITLE = {Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2018)},
	PAGES     = {6306--6314},
	LOCATION  = {Salt Lake City},
} 

For now I have upgraded and tested the code to be compatible with tensorflow 1.x.

I will add a link to download the pre-trained weights and create a main to use the inference from the command line.
